<h2 style={ "color: " + colorLookup.text}>What is MuseTree?</h2>
<p>
    MuseTree lets you work with an AI to generate music in range of styles.
    It is designed for non-musicians interested in creating music, and small content creators e.g. YouTubers.
</p>

<h2 style={ "color: " + colorLookup.text}>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
    In the <b>Tree View</b>, right-click the red <b>Root</b> node and select <b>Request More</b>.
    This asks the AI to generate some music.
    It can take up to a minute, so be patient.
</p>
<p>
    When you see the four children under the root node, try clicking one to select it.
    The <b>Track View</b> will display the notes and you will the audio begin to play.
    Pick your favourite child, and ask the AI to generate a follow-up section, then delete the others.
</p>
<p>
    You can control the AI using the <b>Generation Options</b> on the right-hand side of the screen.
    Each option has a tooltip explaining what that setting does.
</p>
<p>
    When you are happy with your track, right-click the bottom node and choose <b>Save Audio</b>.
</p>

<h2 style={ "color: " + colorLookup.text}>Advanced Tips</h2>
<p>
    After right-clicking a node, each option in the context menu has one letter underlined.
    Rather than clicking the button, you can just press the underline key on your keyboard.
    This works even if the menu is not open, as long as you are hovering over that node.
    Other hotkeys are <b>space</b> for play/pause and <b>z</b> for undo.
</p>
<p>
    If all four children of a node are identical, be careful.
    MuseNet may have started overfitting, and could be generating a real song.
    Try increasing the <b>Temperature</b> before asking the AI to try again.
</p>
<p>
    There is a <b>Delete All</b> option if you right-click the root node.
</p>
<p>
    You can change the instruments or other settings mid-way through a track and MuseNet will try to seamlessly transition to the new settings.
