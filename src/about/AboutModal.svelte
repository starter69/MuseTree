    MuseTree is a custom front-end for <a href="https://openai.com/blog/musenet/" target="_blank">OpenAi's MuseNet</a>,
    the AI music generator.
    The official app is a toy designed to show off the research.
    In contrast, MuseTree is designed for real music production, and has been built from the ground-up with that in
    mind.

    MuseTree is still in active development. I'm very happy to take suggestions, so please open a GitHub issue or
    comment on an existing one with your ideas!
    If you want to chat with me in real time, I <a href="https://twitch.tv/stevenwaterman" target="_blank">live-code on twitch.tv</a> Mon-Fri 2-6pm BST.
    At the minute, those streams are mostly my work on MuseTree, so come along and say hi!
